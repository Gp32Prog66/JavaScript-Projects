// NOTE: console.log prints text to the browser console that you can enable
//       to see the output. It is a little bit more convenient than alert so
//       we will use it most of the time.

// Why should we use arrays? //
//---------------------------//
console.log("Why should we use arrays?");


//The reason we need to use arrays is to store large amounts of information easily compared to individually declaring data for each piece of information.
//It would be very tedious if we had to declare variables each time with different information. The great thing about Arrays are that they are dynamic in length,
//so they can grow whenever needed in a program



//----------------------------------//
// Creating and initializing arrays //
//----------------------------------//
console.log("Creating and initializing arrays");

// 1. Study the following sequence: 1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 15, 14, 42, ...
//    Create an array with the first 25 elements of this sequence.
//    Obviously this has to be done programmatically.

var mathSequence = [1,3];

var isEven = function (x)
{
  console.log(x);
  return (x % 2 == 0) ? true : false;
}

for (var i = 0; i < 25; i++)
{

  
  if (mathSequence[i] === (isEven()))
  {
    mathSequence[i] * 3;
  }
  else
  {
    mathSequence[i] - 1;
  }


  var next = mathSequence[i] + mathSequence[i];
  mathSequence.push(next);
}
console.log(mathSequence);
/*
for (var i = 1; i < mathSequence.length; i++)
{
console.log(mathSequence[i++]);
}
*/
//-----------------//
// Adding elements //
//-----------------//
console.log("Adding elements");

// Use this array to answer the questions below.
var arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];

// 1. Add 9 and 10 to the end of the array. Make sure you keep the order.
arr.push(9,10);
console.log(arr); 


// 2. Add 0 and 1 to the beginning of the array. Make sure you keep the order.
arr.unshift(0,1);
console.log(arr);

/*
for (var i=arr.length; i>=0; i--)
{
  arr[i] = arr[i-1];
}
arr[0] = -1; 

console.log(arr);
*/


//-------------------//
// Removing elements //
//-------------------//
console.log("Removing elements");

// Use the array from the 'Adding elements' section.

// 1. Remove 9 and 10 from the end of the array.
arr.pop();
arr.pop();
console.log(arr);

// 2. Remove 0 and 1 from the beginning of the array.
arr.shift();
arr.shift();
console.log(arr);



//-------------------------------------------------------//
// Adding and removing elements from a specific position //
//-------------------------------------------------------//
console.log("Adding and removing elements from a specific position");

// Use the array from the 'Adding elements' section.

// 1. Remove all elements except the first and last.

arr.splice(1, arr.length-2);
console.log(arr);

//2,3,4,5,6,7,8
// 2. Insert the numbers that were just removed back into the array.
arr.splice(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8);

//Original State of Array
console.log("Original State of Array");
console.log(arr);

// NOTE: arr should be back to its original state at this point.



//---------------------------------------------//
// Two-dimensional and multidimensional arrays //
//---------------------------------------------//
console.log("Two-dimensional and multidimensional arrays");

// 1. Multiply the row elements together in the two dimensional array below
//    and then sum the result. So for the array below one would get
//    (1*2*3)+(4*5*6)+(7*8*9). Print the result to the console.
//    NOTE: obviously the code should still work if the numbers in the array
//          are changed.

var arr = [[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]];

var mult = 1;
for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
{
  var innerArray = arr[i];
  for (var j = 0; j < innerArray.length; j++)
  {
    mult *= innerArray[j];
  }
}
console.log("2D arry multiplication is " + mult);

// Use the following two arrays to answer the next questions.

var positiveNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0];
var negativeNumbers = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1];

// 1. Create a new array 'numbers' from the above arrays that contains all
//    numbers in order.

var numbers = positiveNumbers.concat([negativeNumbers]); 

// 2. Check if some numbers in the numbers array are larger than or equal to 0
//    and print the result to the console.

function greaterOrEqualToZero(a)
{
  return a >= 0;
}

console.log(numbers.every(greaterOrEqualToZero));
console.log(numbers.every(function(a)
{
  return a >= 0;

// 3. Create a new array that only contains the odd numbers from the numbers
//    array
